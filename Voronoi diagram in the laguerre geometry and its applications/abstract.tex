In recent years, due to frequent password leakage problems, more and more websites have gradually applied two-step verification, especially SMS-based authentication. However, more than half of people think that this interaction is not friendly because it requires lots of human efforts. The current well-known two-step authentication mechanisms have reduced human efforts, but there are many security issues. In this paper, we propose Sentoa: A sensor-based two-step authentication mechanism, which complete the authentication with little human effort and has a strong security guarantee to defend against both remote attacks and proximate attacks. We implemented Sentoa on several sensor-rich Android smart device (i.e., smartphone) and a server that deploys landing pages and classifiers. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Sentoa : (1) Classifiers used to determine that two sets of sensor information belong to the same environment, (2) Effective ultrasound wave transmission distance. Our extensive evaluations show that the Sentoa mechanism is an effective and practical approach to defeat remote attack with an accuracy above 99\% without human efforts and control the secure verification distance to 10$cm$ to defeat proximate attack.
